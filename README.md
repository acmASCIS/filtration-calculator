# Filtration Points Calculator

This tool is made to calculate filtration points for the trainees.

## How to Use

You'll need to run `npm run build` to fetch the trainees data before running the calculator.
But first `points.json` file is required to act as the configuration file for the points.

Here's an example for the `points.json` file:

```json
{
  "contests": ["259043", "259389", "259644"],
  "points": [[1, 3, 1, 2, 2 , 3], [2, 3, 1, 1, 3], [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3]]
}
```
